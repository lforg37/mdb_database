Database docker.
As oracle does not diffuse freely oracle-11g installations files, we cannot provide a fully automatised build setup. Please follow [jaspeen/oracle](https://github.com/jaspeen/oracle-11g) to get a oracle11g-installed docker image with a working oracle 11g instance.

The Dockerfile of yhis project expects to find an oracle11g-installed image.
